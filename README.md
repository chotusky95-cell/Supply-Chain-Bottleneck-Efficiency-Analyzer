# Supply-Chain-Bottleneck-Efficiency-Analyzer
This project analyzes logistics and operations data to identify inefficiencies across warehouse, transport, and delivery stages. Using lead-time analysis, delay variance–based bottleneck detection, fulfillment rate evaluation, cost vs delivery tradeoffs, and demand trends, it supports optimized scheduling and reduced operational delays.
